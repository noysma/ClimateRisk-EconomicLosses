# Climate Risk and Economic Losses

This dataset contains critical information about the Global Climate Risk Index and associated economic data for countries around the world. The data provides insight into the effects of climate-related disasters on countries, allowing us to understand which areas are most affected. This dataset includes columns such as geom, cri_rank, cri_score, fatalities_per_100k_rank, fatalities per 100k total, fatalities rank, and more. With this powerful data set at your disposal you can gain a better understanding of which areas are most vulnerable to climate related disasters and begin to plan solutions that could potentially mitigate potential losses. Join us in creating a future where people are protected from the effects of global climate change!
